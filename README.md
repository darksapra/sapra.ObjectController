# Object Controller
This repository contains the basic structure to build a character controller, following a certain workflow. 
It allows the user to create different modules that can be structured so that components inside can be shown, hidden, and overall enabled and disabled 

It contains a samples folder, showing an example of component structure. 

The benefits of using this is allowing for a better component organisation inside a character controller, improving the modularity and flexibility. 

Not only that, but the structure allows for the creation of any type of object controller.
