# Object Controller
This repository contains the basic structure to build an object controller, following a certain workflow. 
It allows the user to create different modules that can be structured so that components inside can be shown, hidden, and overall enabled and disabled 

It contains a samples folder, showing an example of component structure. 

The benefits of using this is allowing for a better component organisation inside a character controller, improving the modularity and flexibility. 

Not only that, but the structure allows for the creation of any type of object controller. 

## Before
As soon as the character controller gets complex and you want to keep modularity on it, components start to overflow the inspector, making it hard to easily find what you are looking for.

## After
By using this workflow, components are nicely grouped, without losing the control over them.
