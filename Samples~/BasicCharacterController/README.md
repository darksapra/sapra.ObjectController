Character Controller
Simplified version of my Character Controller, configurable for players and NPCs.

The intention of this Character Controller is to hold all the features I feel a character controller needs, and have them so it's configurable and workable with it.

Capabilities
This version of the controller currently can do:

Jump
Walk
Swim
Crouch
Move in the air
In addition to that, it contains:

Object Water Physics
Variable Gravity Capability
First and Third person control (via the PDirectionManager)
Runtime stat modifier (Adapt velocity depending on diferent factors)
PEasyWalk (capable to walk on slopes and varying terrain easily
The project is currently for personal use, therefore it might contain:

Commented lines (coming from previous iterations, bug fixed, and for test purposes)
Catalan text (my main language is catalan, and therefore there might be variables and comments in English or Catalan)
Confusing method names (in some cases, the names of the methods might not be changed to reflect the real method, since it is still in development)
Unoptimized methods
No cleaning has been done.
